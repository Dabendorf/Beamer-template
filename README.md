# LaTeX beamer template including many examples
This little project is a beamer template I have built up over many years as a university student

It includes an automatic navigation bar and a quite convenient way of adding new slides.

Contributions are welcome

You can see how the presentation looks like by opening the [``Beamer_Template_EN.pdf``](https://github.com/Dabendorf/Beamer-template/blob/master/Beamer_Template_EN.pdf).

# Content
This project includes a lot of examples such as
* The structure of a beamer presentation
* Slide transitions
* Text blocks
* Programme code
* Math mode
* Column format

# Structure
The main file is the ``Premable.tex`` file. The main code of the presentation can be found in ``Presentation.tex``.

All examples are explained in detail in ``ExamplesLaTeX.tex``.

Duck photos are in the ``images/``-folder
